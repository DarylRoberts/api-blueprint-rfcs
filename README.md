# API Blueprint Request for Comments

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a
bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the API Blueprint team.

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent
and controlled path for new features to enter the language.

## When you need to follow this process

You need to follow this process if you intend to make "substantial" changes to
the API Blueprint language or specification.

## What the process is

In short, to get a major feature added to the API Blueprint language and/or
parser, one must first get an RFC relevant to that feature merged and accepted
into the RFC repository as a markdown file. At that point the RFC is 'active'
and may be implemented with the goal of eventual inclusion into API Blueprint.

Please see [RFC 1](rfcs/0001-rfc-process.md) for more details.

## Related

The RFC process is inspired by, and very similar to
[PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/), [DEP](https://github.com/django/deps)
and the [Rust RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).
